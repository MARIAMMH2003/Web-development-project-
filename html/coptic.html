                          <p>At th end of of the potolemaic era the local egyptain were known as Aegyptioi,
                             from the toponym Aegyptos (Egypt). The Word Aegyptos itself is derived from the
                              ancient name of the capital Memphis, Ha ka Ptah,'the house of the soul of Ptah,'
                              Which was the main deity of the pantheon of Memphis, the ancient capital and thus
                               of the hole country. Removing the aspired H, confusing between k and g and finally
                                adding the os greek syllabus, we have the word Aegyptos. When the Arabs conquered 
                                Egypt in AD 641 the name Aegyptioi was transcribed in the Arabic alphabet, which 
                                lacks vowels and the letter 'p.' The word thus became Qbt, pronounced qibt,
                                 from where the word 'Copt' is derived. Since then the word Qbt is used to indicate 
                                 the local population of Christian religion,Though since its origins it refers to 
                                 the Egyptian in general.</p></div>

                            <p style="font-size: 21px;">Coptic antiquities encompass a wide array of artifacts, each bearing testimony to
                               the vibrant cultural tapestry of early Christian Egypt. Among the most renowned 
                               are the intricately decorated textiles and garments, adorned with richly symbolic
                                motifs and designs. These textiles not only served as practical items of clothing 
                                but also held deep religious significance, often used in rituals and ceremonies
                                 within the Coptic community.</p></div>

                            <p style="font-size: 21px;">Coptic monuments hold profound historical significance, serving as tangible reminders of
                               Egypt's Christian heritage. They bear witness to the spread of Christianity in
                                Egypt, the rise of monasticism, and the enduring faith of generations of believers.
                                 Moreover, they offer valuable insights into the complex interplay between religion,
                                  culture, and politics in ancient Egypt.</p></div>
