It could have also been used for holding personal accessories. The table takes the shape of a hexagonal prism decorated with vegetal, geometric, animal, and epigraphic motifs quoting Quranic and invocational phrases. A small double-leafed door opens up on one of its sides and is decorated with vegetal elements." </p>
